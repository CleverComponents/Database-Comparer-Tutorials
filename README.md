# Database-Comparer-Tutorials

Now, more than ten years on the market, the Dabase Comparer got lots of feedback and usage experience. Our customers asked us about code examples, demos and "How To" code snippets.   
To summarize the experience, we decided to publish the most commonly asked examples and code snippets in our [Knowledge Base](https://www.clevercomponents.com/portal/KB/c1/all-articles.aspx)

This repository represents a list of examples, code snippets and demo projects for the [Database Comparer VCL Tutorials](https://www.clevercomponents.com/portal/kb/c11/database-comparer-vcl.aspx). This list will be periodically updated, new projects will be added.   
Please stay tuned to new examples and use cases of the [Database Comparer VCL](https://www.clevercomponents.com/products/dbcvcl/) library.
